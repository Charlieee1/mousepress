# MousePress
A command line application that plays sounds of a mechanical mouse when you click.
Inspired by https://github.com/thekevinlab and the project https://github.com/thekevinlab/keypress.
Much of the code is also from there, not all of this is mine.
All sounds are from thekevinlab/keypress.
